    <p>DRINKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM</p>
</header>

<main>
    <article class="briefing-card">
        <p class="intro-text">In the United Kingdom, people drink many different drinks every day. Children and adults both enjoy these drinks at home, at school, at work, and in cafés. Some drinks are <span class="vocab" data-nl="traditioneel">traditional</span>, and some are more modern. The most famous British drink is tea, but there are many other popular drinks too.</p>

        <h2>Tea – The Most Famous Drink</h2>
        <p>Tea is very important in British culture. Many people drink tea every day. Some people drink several cups of tea a day. Most people drink black tea. They usually add milk, and sometimes they add sugar. British tea is often strong and hot.</p>
        
        <p>People drink tea in the morning with breakfast. They also drink tea in the afternoon and in the evening. When a guest visits a house, the <span class="vocab" data-nl="gastheer / gastvrouw">host</span> often asks, “Would you like a <span class="vocab" data-nl="kopje">cup</span> of tea?” Offering tea is a friendly and polite thing to do.</p>
        
        <p>People usually drink tea from a cup. A cup is quite small and often comes with a <span class="vocab" data-nl="schoteltje">saucer</span>. However, some people prefer to drink tea from a <span class="vocab" data-nl="mok">mug</span>. A mug is bigger than a cup and does not usually have a saucer. Many people use a mug at home because it holds more tea.</p>

        <div class="highlight-quote">
            "There is also something called <strong>'afternoon tea.'</strong> This is a light meal in the afternoon with tea, small sandwiches, and cakes. It is popular in hotels and cafés. Many tourists like to try afternoon tea when they visit the UK."
        </div>

        <p>Today, people also drink herbal tea and green tea. Some people choose these because they think they are healthier.</p>

        <h2>Coffee – Popular and Modern</h2>
        <p>Coffee is also very popular in the UK. In the past, tea was much more popular than coffee. Today, many people drink coffee every day, especially young adults.</p>
        
        <p>There are many coffee shops in British cities and towns. People buy drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos. Some people drink black coffee, and others add milk and sugar. Many workers buy a takeaway coffee on their way to work.</p>
        
        <p>Coffee is often served in a mug at home. In cafés, it can be served in a cup or a mug, depending on the type of coffee. A mug is often used for larger drinks. Students and friends often meet in coffee shops. These cafés are places to relax, talk, or do homework.</p>

        <h2>Soft Drinks and Squash</h2>
        <p>Children and teenagers often drink <span class="vocab" data-nl="frisdrank">soft drinks</span>. These include <span class="vocab" data-nl="limonade">lemonade</span>, cola, and fruit <span class="vocab" data-nl="sap">juice</span>. Many families buy soft drinks in shops to keep in the fridge.</p>
        
        <p>Another popular British drink is called “squash.” Squash is a sweet liquid with fruit <span class="vocab" data-nl="smaak">flavour</span>. You do not drink it alone. You mix it with water. Squash can be orange, lemon, or blackcurrant flavour. Many children drink squash at home.</p>
        
        <p>Fruit juice is also common. People often drink orange juice in the morning. Apple juice is also popular. Some juices contain a lot of sugar, so many families choose drinks with less sugar.</p>

        <h2>Milk and Hot Chocolate</h2>
        <p>Milk is an important drink in the UK. Many children drink milk every day. It is often part of breakfast with cereal. Some schools give milk to younger children.</p>
        
        <p>Hot chocolate is very popular in autumn and winter. When it is cold outside, people like to drink something warm and sweet. Hot chocolate is often made with milk and cocoa powder. Some people add cream or marshmallows on top.</p>
        
        <p>Hot chocolate is usually served in a mug because it is bigger than a cup. A mug keeps the drink warm for longer.</p>

        <h2>Water and Healthy Choices</h2>
        <p>Water is very important for everyone. In the UK, tap water is safe to drink. People can drink water directly from the tap in the kitchen. Many people carry a reusable water bottle during the day.</p>
        
        <p>Schools <span class="vocab" data-nl="aanmoedigen">encourage</span> students to drink water. Many children bring a bottle of water to school. Water is more healthy than drinks with a lot of sugar.</p>
        
        <p>Today, many families try to choose healthier drinks. Some people drink sugar-free soft drinks. Others drink more water and less cola. People think more about healthy food and drinks than in the past.</p>

        <h2>Drinks at Home and Outside</h2>
        <p>Most drinks are drunk at home. Families buy tea, milk, juice, and squash in shops. People drink tea in the morning, water during the day, and maybe hot chocolate in the evening.</p>
        
        <p>People also drink drinks in cafés, restaurants, and at parties. At birthday parties, children often drink lemonade or juice. At family dinners, people may drink water or soft drinks.</p>
        
        <p>During <span class="vocab" data-nl="viering">celebration</span> events, such as Christmas, people sometimes drink special drinks, like sparkling apple juice.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Drinks are an important part of daily life in the United Kingdom. Traditional tea is the most famous. Coffee is popular in cities and towns. Children often drink squash, juice, and milk. Water is healthy and easy to get because tap water is safe to drink.</p>
        <p>Whether people use a cup or a mug, a warm drink is an important part of British life.</p>
