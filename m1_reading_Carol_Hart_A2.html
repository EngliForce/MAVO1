      <h2>📖 Story</h2>
      <p>Detective Carol Hart sat at her desk. She looked out the window. It was raining. Her hands were cold. Her coffee was cold too.</p>
      <p>On her desk was a photo. In the photo, she was young and happy. She stood next to a red motorbike. Now, she didn’t ride anymore. Tomorrow would be her last day at work.</p>
      <p>Carol wasn’t excited. Her pension was small, and she didn’t have much money. She wanted to travel to Italy or Greece, but she couldn’t afford it.</p>
      <p>Someone knocked on the door. It was Officer Jake Bell. He was young and friendly.</p>
      <p>“Detective Hart,” he said. “There was a break-in at the Goldman Gallery.”</p>
      <p>“What’s missing?” Carol asked.</p>
      <p>“A painting,” Jake said. “It’s called The Blue Storm. It’s very expensive.”</p>
      <p>Carol knew the painting. It was worth more than three million pounds.</p>
      <p>She stood up. Her knees hurt, but she was ready. “Let’s go,” she said. “I can solve one more case.”</p>
      <p>At the gallery, the alarm had stopped for ten minutes. The back door was not broken.</p>
      <p>“Someone knows the code,” Carol said. “It’s an inside job.”</p>
      <p>They spoke to the security guard. He looked nervous. “I didn’t turn off the alarm,” he said.</p>
      <p>Two days later, Carol and Jake sat in a café. “Do you remember Mrs. Baines, the cleaner?” Carol asked.</p>
      <p>Jake nodded. “She said she was sick on Tuesday,” Carol said, “but the log says she was at the gallery.”</p>
      <p>That night, Carol went to the gallery and talked to Mrs. Baines. The woman looked surprised, but she let her in.</p>
      <p>In the interview room, Mrs. Baines told the truth. “My nephew needed money,” she said. “He told me the painting was a copy. But he took the real one.”</p>
      <p>“Where is the painting now?” Carol asked.</p>
      <p>“In a storage unit outside the city,” Mrs. Baines said.</p>
      <p>One week later, the real Blue Storm was back in the gallery. Carol gave in her badge. Jake gave her a card. It said: You are the best. Enjoy Italy.</p>
      <p>She smiled. She didn’t tell anyone, but the reward money went to her team. Now she could take a real holiday.</p>
      <p>Three months later, Carol sat at a café in Rome. She drank a glass of cold white wine. The sun was warm on her face.</p>
      <p>Jake sat across from her with a guidebook. “Ready to see the Colosseum?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“In a minute,” she said. “This is the retirement I dreamed of.”</p>
